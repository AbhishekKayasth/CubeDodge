# CubeDodge
My very first Unity 3D game. A very basic endless runner game. Straightforward gameplay - The player (Red cube) has to dodge obstacle cubes as long as possible.
The project is very basic as I just started learning back then in 2018. The game basically spawns random number of obstacles at random position of the level, the obstacles travel through level and gets detroyed.
